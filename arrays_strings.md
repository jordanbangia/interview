# Arrays, Strings, and Dictionaries
- hash tables are important
- insertion and lookup follow a similar procedure, hash the key and go to a table location
    - this enables O(1) lookup
- in the case of collision, commonly handled with chaining
    - the position is the head of linked list, items are just added to the end
- other method is open addressing
    - makes deletion tricky
    - instead of creating a linked list, all elements are stored in the table
    - when inserting, try at the hashed key value, if its empty insert there, otherwise look for the next available slot that can be placed into
    - when accessing, some procedure is followed
    - the searching for the next available slot is called probing
        - linear - increase space by 1
        - quadratic - increase space by successive outputs of quadratic polynomail
        - double hashing - probing function is another hash function
    - other issue becomes once bucket space is full, searching + insertion becomes much harder
- Java has built in hashcodes
- Python's dictionaries are implemented using hash tables
    - they are arrays whose indexes are obtained using a hash function on the keys
- arrays offer easy random access but hard modification
    - hard to move elements around
- in Java, use StringBuilder for expensive string concatenation and easy string reversal
- in Java, everything is initailized to 0, including arrays
- remember, chars are also ints
- Python uses lists.  Can use arrays, but they are wrappers over C arrays
    - should always uses lists unless you have a good reason to need C style array (possibly speed)
